# alx-portfolio_project : Comfy Zone
## Introduction
This portfolio project is intended to solve a depression problem especially among loners and anyone having difficulties sharing their thought with known people. There are so many pressing issues and people donâ€™t know who/where to let it out to. Hence, it is decreasing the increment in depression. This problem may necessarily not be for everyone. The project is not relevant to a specific locale.
